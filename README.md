# HazeProlog



HazeProlog
 is a Prolog like implementation for embedded systems. You can run it even on an ATtiny85 chip!

"In your journey as a programmer I would encourage you to think beyond the low-level details of how computing machines work, and consider alternative models of programming. Think about how programming can be a collaboration between you and the computer, not you just barking instructions at it."

"Instead of giving computers imperative recipes for doing things, you can give them declarative specifications of problems and let them find the answers. As a human your skill is understanding what needs to be done; the computerâ€™s skill is working out the best way to do it."

*HazeProlog running on Arduino Pro Micro 16MHz:*
